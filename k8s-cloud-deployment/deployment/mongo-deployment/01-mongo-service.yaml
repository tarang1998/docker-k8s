apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mongo # The Service is named mongo. Other resources (like the StatefulSet resource) reference this name for connectivity.
  labels:
    name: mongo
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 27017 # Exposes the Service on port 27017 for communication within the cluster.
      targetPort: 27017 # Maps the Service's port to the MongoDB containerâ€™s port 27017.
  clusterIP: None # Configures this Service as a headless Service. No load balancing or single cluster IP is provided.Instead, it directly maps each StatefulSet pod to a unique DNS record (e.g., mongo-0.mongo, mongo-1.mongo).
  selector:
    app: mongo # Matches pods labeled with app: mongo. Ensures only the MongoDB StatefulSet pods are associated with this Service.


# This headless Service is specifically designed for MongoDB's replica set configuration, each pod needs its own stable DNS entry for communication.

# For a StatefulSet with 3 replicas:
# Pod mongo-0 is accessible via DNS name mongo-0.mongo.
# Pod mongo-1 is accessible via DNS name mongo-1.mongo.
# Pod mongo-2 is accessible via DNS name mongo-2.mongo.

# MongoDB replica set members use these stable DNS entries to replicate data and elect a primary.
